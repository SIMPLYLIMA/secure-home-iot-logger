;; home-iot-logger
;; 
;; This contract provides a secure, immutable logging system for home IoT devices.
;; It allows homeowners to register their NestNode system, add authorized devices,
;; and record cryptographic proofs of device activities without storing sensitive data on-chain.
;; The contract serves as a tamper-proof record for verification and dispute resolution.
